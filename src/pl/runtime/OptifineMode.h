/**
 * @file OptifineMode.h
 * @brief "Bedrock Optifine Mode" host-side optimizations.
 *
 * A suite of host-level performance changes the preloader applies to the process the game
 * runs in. It is split into two tiers by risk:
 *
 *  - **Tier 1** touches only the process/host (allocator, thread scheduling, CPU affinity,
 *    display refresh). It installs no game-code hook, so it cannot change game behaviour and
 *    is safe to default ON.
 *  - **Tier 2** hooks game functions found by pattern scan. A wrong or absent pattern is
 *    detected at runtime and the item is skipped, never partially applied.
 *
 * Every item is independently toggleable so a user can isolate one that misbehaves on their
 * device. The configuration arrives from the launcher as a flat key=value blob (see
 * {@link ConfigureOptifineMode}) rather than one JNI call per option, so the two sides cannot
 * drift out of sync field-by-field.
 *
 * **Honesty contract.** This module never claims a frame rate. It reports only what it
 * actually did ("render thread: SCHED_FIFO 1") or why it did nothing
 * ("render thread: not found yet", "affinity: 2 perf cores < 4"). The launcher renders those
 * strings verbatim.
